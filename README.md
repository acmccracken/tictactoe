# TicTacToe
### * A simple tic tac toe game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Challenges, features, and learning experiences

* I set out to design game logic that was capable of checking for win conditions without manually entering the winning combinations
  * This presented an added challenge of figuring out 2D arrays, which ultimately took more work and code than what I was trying to avoid.
  * The advantage of using a 2D Array was a block of code that was scalable and capable of handling larger grids.

### Icebox features

* An option to play a 4x4 or 5x5 version of tic tac toe
* Additional css styling
* Audio and animation features
